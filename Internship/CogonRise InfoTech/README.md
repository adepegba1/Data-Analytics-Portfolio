# Project Description
- **80 CEREALS**: Diabetes patients need to monitor their sugar intake 
to manage their condition effectively. With 
numerous cereal options available in the market, it 
becomes challenging to identify which ones are 
suitable for diabetes patients. This project aims to 
analyze the sugar content in various cereals and 
identify the best options for diabetes patients
-  **EMPLOYEE SALARIES FOR DIFFERENT JOB ROLES**: Understanding employee salaries by job role is crucial for 
organizations to ensure fair compensation, attract and retain top 
talent, and maintain a competitive edge in the market. This 
presentation provides an in-depth analysis of employee salaries 
across various job roles, offering insights into current trends, 
patterns, and disparities. By examining salary data, i aim to identify 
areas for improvement, optimize compensation strategies, and 
enhance overall organizational performance.
- **CUSTOMER PERSONALITY ANALYSIS**: Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s 
ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its 
customers and makes it easier for them to modify products 
according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different 
types of customers.
• Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product 
based on its target customers from different types of customer 
segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new 
product to every customer in the company’s database, a company 
can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the 
product and then market the product only on that particular 
segment
